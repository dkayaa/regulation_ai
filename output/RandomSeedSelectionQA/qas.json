Therefore, without more information from other sections, the labeling requirements in Section 8 cannot be assumed to apply to composite packs just based on the definition provided in Section 6.\"}, {\"Question\": \"Assuming a non-prescription medicine has a registered trademark that readily identifies the sponsor, can the trademark be used instead of the actual sponsor name on the intermediate packaging label?\", \"Answer\": \"Yes\", \"Answer Explanation\": \"Section 8(4)(f) allows using 'a registered trademark if it readily identifies the sponsor or distributor of the medicine' on the intermediate packaging label instead of the actual sponsor\/distributor name. Section 6 is not directly relevant to this question.\"}, {\"Question\": \"Assuming a non-prescription medicine composite pack has its container label information obscured by the intermediate packaging, does the intermediate packaging label need to include the sponsor name?\", \"Answer\": \"Yes\", \"Answer Explanation\": \"Section 6 establishes that 'composite pack' has the meaning given in the Act for this regulation. Section 8(4) states that if the container label is obscured by intermediate packaging, the intermediate packaging label must include the sponsor\/distributor name or registered trademark. Taken together, this means composite packs are subject to the Section 8(4) labeling requirements for intermediate packaging obscuring the container label.\"}]}"
