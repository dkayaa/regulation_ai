                    "Answer": "No",
                    "Answer Explanation": "Based on the regulation sections provided, if a medicine contains four or more active ingredients and subsection 8(2) applies, then compliance with paragraphs 9(1)(b) and 9(1)(c) is not required (section c). Furthermore, if subsection 8(2) applies and the medicine includes one or more active ingredients with a name that includes descriptors like chemical salts, then the names of active ingredients may be included on a side or rear panel or label, in a text size of not less than 2.5mm (section d).
